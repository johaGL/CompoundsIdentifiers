### You are in the `extra` folder


If willing to re-run HMDB related scripts, before anything, the following is required:

1. go to  https://hmdb.ca/downloads
2. download "All Metabolites" dataset, it's a zip file
3. locate the zip file into this `extra` folder
4. unzip the file, this will produce the `hmdb_metabolites.xml` file, of ~6.5GB (too heavy, so not included in this repository)
5. Go to the main README to see the rest of the steps.
 
If you run successfully those steps you will have 3 files in this `extra` folder:

- hmdb.csv
- hmdb_metabolites.xml
- hmdb_metabolites.zip
